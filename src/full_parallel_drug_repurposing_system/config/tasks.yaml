  description: |-
    Create comprehensive drug repurposing strategy for {compound_name} by synthesizing the provided context from all specialists.
    
    **DO NOT USE TOOLS OR SEARCH. RELY SOLELY ON THE PROVIDED CONTEXT.**

    **SYNTHESIS APPROACH:**
    1.  Review and integrate findings from scientific literature, molecular data, safety analysis, competitive intelligence, regulatory assessment, and disease area mapping.
    2.  Cross-reference these findings to identify the strongest repurposing opportunities.

    **SYNTHESIS FRAMEWORK:**
    - Identify top 3-5 repurposing opportunities based on mechanism alignment
    - Assess market potential and competitive positioning
    - Evaluate regulatory feasibility and development timeline
    - Prioritize opportunities with highest success probability
